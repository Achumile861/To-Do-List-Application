Your `ToDoListApp.java` is a well-structured JavaFX application for managing tasks. Here's a breakdown of the code and how it operates:

Overview

The application allows users to manage tasks through a graphical interface using JavaFX. It includes functionalities to add, edit, and delete tasks displayed in a ListView.

 Key Components

Main Application (`ToDoListApp`)

- Initialization: 
  - `taskManager`: Manages tasks using `TaskManager`.
  - `taskListView`: Displays tasks using a JavaFX `ListView<TaskView>`.

- GUI Setup:
  - Buttons (`addButton`, `editButton`, `deleteButton`): Actions for adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
  - `VBox`: Layout container for `taskListView` and buttons.

- Event Handling:
  - `addButton`: Adds a new task to `taskManager` and updates `taskListView`.
  - `editButton`: Simulates editing a task's due date and updates `taskManager` and `taskListView`.
  - `deleteButton`: Deletes a selected task from `taskManager` and `taskListView`.

Task Class (`Task`)

- Represents a task with attributes such as `title`, `description`, `dueDate`, and `isCompleted`.
- Provides methods (`getters` and `setters`) for accessing and modifying task attributes.
- Overrides `toString()` to format task information for display.

TaskManager Class (`TaskManager`)

- Manages a list of tasks (`taskList`).
- Provides methods (`addTask`, `editTask`, `deleteTask`, `getTasks`) to manipulate tasks in `taskList`.

TaskView Class (`TaskView`)

- Custom JavaFX component representing a task view.
- Displays task information (`title` and `dueDate`) using `Label` components.

 Running the Application

To run the application:
1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher installed.
2. Set up your IDE with JavaFX support (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the `ToDoListApp.java` class.

 Improvements and Customization

- Enhanced UI: Improve layout and styling using JavaFX CSS.
- Persistence: Implement data storage using databases or file systems.
- Task Sorting: Add sorting options for tasks based on due date or completion status.
Conclusion

This application provides a foundation for task management using JavaFX, demonstrating fundamental operations like adding, editing, and deleting tasks. It can be expanded with additional features and enhancements to meet specific requirements.
